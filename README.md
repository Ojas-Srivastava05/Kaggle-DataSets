## 🎯 Getting Started

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
```bash
# Install Python (if you don't have it)
# Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Check your Python version (should be 3.8 or higher)
python --version
```

### Step 2: Get This Repository
```bash
# Download all projects to your computer
git clone <repository-url>

# Enter the directory
cd "Kaggle DataSets"
```

### Step 3: Install the Tools
```bash
# Install all required libraries at once
pip install -r requirements.txt

# OR install individually:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### Step 4: Launch Jupyter Notebook
```bash
# Start the interactive environment
jupyter notebook

# Your browser will open - navigate to any project!
```

## 🔄 Project Workflow
